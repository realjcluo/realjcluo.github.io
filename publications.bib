	abstract = {Based on multidimensional health, we aimed to identify health groups among the elderly Chinese population, and examine its relationship with socio-demographic factors on healthcare utilization. Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey in 2014 was adopted. For 2981 participants aged ≥65 years, without missing any health indicators, latent class analysis was adopted to identify health groups. For 1974 participants with complete information, the two-part model was used to assess how health groups and socio-demographic characteristics influence the outpatient and inpatient expenditure. Four health groups were identified and labeled as “Lacking Socialization” (10.4\%), “High Comorbidity” (16.7\%), “Severe Disability” (7.8\%), and “Relative Health” (65.1\%). Compared with the relative health group, the lacking socialization group cost higher inpatient expenditure (p = 0.02). Those in the high comorbidity and severe disability groups were more likely to use healthcare services and cost higher outpatient expenditure (p \&lt; 0.01 for all). The effects of socio-demographic factors were also discussed. The findings enhanced our understanding of the heterogeneity of multidimensional health status and complex healthcare demands in the elderly Chinese population. Moreover, it is valuable for improving the allocation of healthcare resource targeted for different groups of the ageing population.},

	abstract = {With the deepening population aging process in China, the medical expenses of older adults has become a widespread concerned. Medical insurance is a major source of Chinese medical financing and payment. The study aims to understand the current status of medical expenses for older adults and explore the effect of different types of health insurance on medical expenses in China.
        The data came from the Chinese Longitudinal Health Longevity Survey (CLHLS) in 2014. The Kruskal–Wallis test and general multivariate linear regression model were applied to analyze the current situation and to explore how medical insurance as the main payment impacts medical expenses.
        A total of 4376 older participants were included in this study. The median of medical expenses of a total was 1500 Yuan per year. The proportions of participants who had the urban employee-based basic medical insurance (UE-BMI), the urban residents basic medical insurance (UR-BMI), the new rural cooperative medical insurance scheme (NCMS), and the commercial medical insurance were 10.8\%, 8.4\%, 72.7\%, and 0.9\%, respectively. 34.8\% of older adults paid the health care service via the NCMS and 11.9\% paid via the UE-BMI. Participating in the NCMS and UR-BMI are significantly related to the level of the medical fees of older adults. UE-BMI, UR-BMI, and NCMS as main payment eased the pressure of medical expenses.
        The influence of different types of medical insurances as main payments on the medical expenses of older adults is varied. Implementation of medical insurance should be taken to further relieve the medical expenses of older adults.},

	abstract = {Objectives
China is currently facing an unprecedented complex health demand from a rapidly aging population. Based on multidimensional health, this study aimed to identify heterogeneous latent health classes for older Chinese people, and assess regional disparities and associated sociodemographic factors.
Study design
Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey in 2014 was adopted.
Methods
For 2886 participants aged 65 years and more without missing health indicators in physical, psychological, and social dimensions, latent class analysis was used to identify heterogeneous health. For 2128 participants with complete information, logistic regressions were used to examine how regional divisions and sociodemographic factors impact each identified class.
Results
Four classes were identified and labeled as ‘Lacking Socialization’ (17.4\%), ‘High Comorbidity’ (13.7\%), ‘Functional Impairment’ (7.1\%), and ‘Relative Health’ (61.8\%). When the Relative Health class was the reference, the likelihoods of the High Comorbidity and Functional Impairment classes were higher for older adults in eastern and central regions than in western regions. Those in eastern regions also tended to be in the Lacking Socialization class than in western regions. The effects of regional divisions on the different classes were significantly impacted by sociodemographic characteristics.
Conclusions
Four health classes identified by multidimensional health have enhanced our understanding of heterogeneity among older Chinese people. By examining regional disparities in China, our study provided evidence for health policies addressing the issue of aging with respect to regional disparities.},

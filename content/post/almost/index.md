ChatGPT version: 

I'm almost finished with my thesis; I only have the discussion part left to write. I need to integrate the previous sections and make them more coherent so I can have a complete picture of my entire project before writing the discussion.

I'm a bit worried because I've noticed that some people have started publishing papers related to my current project. Maybe I need to prepare a short paper for submission.

I don't know. On one hand, I'm almost at the end of the journey, but on the other hand, I lack the motivation to push forward. It feels strange.

Original version:

Almost finish my thesis, only got the discussion part to go. Need to pull previous part together and make it more coherent, so I can have a full picture of my whole project before writing the discussion. 

A little bit of worry cos I noticed some people starting publishing paper related to my current project. Maybe I need to sort out some short paper for submission.

I don't know, on the one hand, almost at the end of the journey, but on the other hand, lack the spirit to push me forward. That sounds so strange.

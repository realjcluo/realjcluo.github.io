I'm a self-motivated PhD student in Epidemiology and Public Health. My research interests revolve around social relationships and disability among older Chinese people. I have developed quantitative and analytical skills with a strong capacity to conduct independent research. I am interested in developing a career that combines teaching and research, while maintaining my interest in collaborating with people from multidisciplinary background.

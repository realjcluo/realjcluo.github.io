I am a PhD student in Epidemiology and Public Health at University College London. My research interests revolve around social relationships and disability in later life. I also work with the International Centre For Lifecourse Studies (ICLS). I am interested in developing a career that combines teaching and research, while maintaining my interest in public engagement on ageing into disability.

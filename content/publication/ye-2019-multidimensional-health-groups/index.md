abstract: Based on multidimensional health, we aimed to identify health groups among
  the elderly Chinese population, and examine its relationship with socio-demographic
  factors on healthcare utilization. Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey
  in 2014 was adopted. For 2981 participants aged ≥65 years, without missing any health
  indicators, latent class analysis was adopted to identify health groups. For 1974
  participants with complete information, the two-part model was used to assess how
  health groups and socio-demographic characteristics influence the outpatient and
  inpatient expenditure. Four health groups were identified and labeled as “Lacking
  Socialization” (10.4%), “High Comorbidity” (16.7%), “Severe Disability” (7.8%),
  and “Relative Health” (65.1%). Compared with the relative health group, the lacking
  socialization group cost higher inpatient expenditure (p = 0.02). Those in the high
  comorbidity and severe disability groups were more likely to use healthcare services
  and cost higher outpatient expenditure (p &lt; 0.01 for all). The effects of socio-demographic
  factors were also discussed. The findings enhanced our understanding of the heterogeneity
  of multidimensional health status and complex healthcare demands in the elderly
  Chinese population. Moreover, it is valuable for improving the allocation of healthcare
  resource targeted for different groups of the ageing population.

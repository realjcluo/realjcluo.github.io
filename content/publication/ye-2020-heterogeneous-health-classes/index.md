abstract: Objectives China is currently facing an unprecedented complex health demand
  from a rapidly aging population. Based on multidimensional health, this study aimed
  to identify heterogeneous latent health classes for older Chinese people, and assess
  regional disparities and associated sociodemographic factors. Study design Chinese
  Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey in 2014 was adopted. Methods For 2886 participants
  aged 65 years and more without missing health indicators in physical, psychological,
  and social dimensions, latent class analysis was used to identify heterogeneous
  health. For 2128 participants with complete information, logistic regressions were
  used to examine how regional divisions and sociodemographic factors impact each
  identified class. Results Four classes were identified and labeled as ‘Lacking Socialization’
  (17.4%), ‘High Comorbidity’ (13.7%), ‘Functional Impairment’ (7.1%), and ‘Relative
  Health’ (61.8%). When the Relative Health class was the reference, the likelihoods
  of the High Comorbidity and Functional Impairment classes were higher for older
  adults in eastern and central regions than in western regions. Those in eastern
  regions also tended to be in the Lacking Socialization class than in western regions.
  The effects of regional divisions on the different classes were significantly impacted
  by sociodemographic characteristics. Conclusions Four health classes identified
  by multidimensional health have enhanced our understanding of heterogeneity among
  older Chinese people. By examining regional disparities in China, our study provided
  evidence for health policies addressing the issue of aging with respect to regional
  disparities.
